# Upgrade the server

## Upgrade `6.X` to `7.0`

### Update agents

temBoard UI 7.0 is compatible with agent 6.X. Still, we suggest you to [upgrade
agents to
7.0](https://temboard.readthedocs.io/projects/agent/en/v7/upgrade.html#x-to-7-0).

*Note: An upgrade of the agent is required if you want to use the new `statements`
plugin.*

### Stop service

Stop `temboard` service:

``` shell
sudo systemctl stop temboard
```

### Update package

Update temboard package with your [preferred installation
method](installation.md#installation).

### Upgrade database structure

With the addition of the `statements` plugin, an upgrade of the repository
database schema is required.

First of all, please make sure that you first did the **upgrade from 5 to 6**.
This is very important!

Then apply `repository` database structure upgrade with the following command:

``` shell
$ sudo -u temboard temboard-migratedb upgrade
```

### Start service

Start `temboard` service:

```shell
sudo systemctl start temboard
```

### Activate statements plugin

Open temBoard in your browser and activate the `statements` plugin for the
different instances on which you want to use it.

## Upgrade `5.X` to `6.0`

temBoard UI 6.0 is compatible with agent 5.X. Still, we suggest you to [upgrade
agents to
6.0](https://temboard.readthedocs.io/projects/agent/en/v6/upgrade.html#x-to-6-0).


Stop `temboard` service:

``` shell
sudo systemctl stop temboard
```

Update temboard package with your [preferred installation
method](installation.md#installation).

The database structure hasn't changed in this release, however temBoard now
requires to version the schema and checks it at startup. This will ease future
updates a lot.

The `repository` database schema must be stamped to the latest version with:

``` shell
$ sudo -u temboard temboard-migratedb stamp
```

Start `temboard` service:

```shell
sudo systemctl start temboard
```
## Upgrade `4.x` to `5.0` (RHEL/CentOS)

Stop `temboard` service:
```shell
sudo systemctl stop temboard
```

New package installation:
```shell
sudo yum install temboard
```

Upgrade `repository` database schema:

```shell
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dalibo/temboard/master/share/sql/upgrade-4-5.sql | sudo -u postgres psql temboard
```

or

```shell
$ sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -1 -f \
     /usr/share/temboard/sql/upgrade-4-5.sql temboard
```

To enable monitoring data purge policy, you need to update `temboard.conf` by
adding the `[monitoring]` section and configure `purge_after` parameter. This
parameter configures the amount of monitoring data, expressed in day, to keep
in the repository. The purge policy is applied every 24 hours.

Start `temboard` service:
```shell
sudo systemctl start temboard
```

### Pull mode

Version 5 comes with a new way to collect monitoring data from the agents.
Before this version, agents were pushing monitoring data to temboard server.
Starting from version 5, temboard server is now able to pull monitoring data
if the target agent has been deployed in version 5 or upper. The server still
supports push mode for the agents still running in version 4.

## Upgrade `0.0.1` to `1.1` (RHEL/CentOS)

`temboard` upgrade process is going to be done within 4 stages:

* Software upgrade
* Configuration update
* Repository upgrade
* Post-upgrade operations

### Software upgrade

First, `temboard` must be stopped:
```shell
sudo systemctl stop temboard
```

New package installation:
```shell
sudo yum install temboard
```

### Configuration update

The following changes should be reflected into the configuration file:

* plugin `supervision` renamed to `monitoring` : parameters `plugins` and `plugins_orm_engine`
* plugin `settings` renamed to `pgconf` : parameter `plugins`
* CA cert. file not required anymore : parameter `ssl_ca_cert_file` can be commented

### Repository upgrade

`temboard` database structure needs to be upgraded too. Before doing anything, you should make a backup of `temboard` database with `pg_dump`.

Once the backup is done, you can proceed with database upgrade:

* Load SQL script `/usr/share/temboard/sql/monitoring.sql` with super-user privileges
* Load upgrade script `/usr/share/temboard/sql/upgrade-0.0.1-1.1.sql` with super-user privileges

If everything goes well, you can drop old data:
```sql
DROP SCHEMA supervision CASCADE;
```

### Post-upgrade operations

Task list clean-up:
```shell
sudo rm /var/run/temboard/task_list
```

Finally, `temboard` can be started:
```shell
sudo systemctl start temboard
```
