Temboard is a powerful mangement tool for PostgreSQL. You can use it monitor, optimize or configure multiple PostgreSQL instances.

Temboard is composed of 2 basic elements:

* An lightweight [agent](agent.md) that you need to install on every PostgreSQL server you want to manage

* A central [server](server.md) that will control the agents and collect metrics from them.

# The Agent

There's 3 different ways to install the agent:

* [On Debian](temboard-agent-install-debian.md)
* [On Red hat](temboard-agent-install-rpm.md)
* [From source](temboard-agent-install-sources.md)

Then you need to [Configure](temboard-agent-configuration.md)




# The Server
